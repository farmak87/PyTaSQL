# Credit_simulator
The credit simulator mimics a service that is usually being rendered by mobile operators across the globe. Customers of mobile operators use  mobile services in advance with further repayment. The purpose of the simulator is a generation of pseudo customers who make pseudo credit request and then pay them back by recharging pseudo-top-ups.
There are two files i: credit_simulator.py and functions.py. The first file is where generally all the logic is written. The second one is a supportive library where all the functions are written. P.S. the code was written by not professional developers, so please donâ€™t judge usðŸ˜Š
