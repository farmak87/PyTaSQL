# Credit_simulator
The credit simulator mimics a service which is usually being rendered by mobile operators across the globe. Customers of mobile operators use any kind of mobile services in advance with further repayment. The purpose of the simulator is generation on pseudo customers which make pseudo credit request and then pay them back by recharging pseudo top-ups.  
There are two files i: credit_simulator.py and functions.py. 
The first file is where generally all the logic is written. The second one is supportive library where all the functions are written.
P.S. the code was written by not professional developers, so please donâ€™t judge usðŸ˜Š
